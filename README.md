Note the project uses dataset from Kaggle: Janhavi Lande, Yashwant Kaurav, Cathy Yu, & Rohitash Chandra. (2022). Global COVID-19 Twitter dataset. Kaggle. https://doi.org/10.34740/KAGGLE/DS/2397387

Global COVID-19 Twitter dataset contains the datasets of tweets for the Countries Australia, India, Brazil, Indonesia, Japan, USA and UK.
# Files
The repository includes individual Jupyter Notebook files for each country's dataset, namely:

Australia.ipynb__
India.ipynb__
Indonesia.ipynb__
Brazil.ipynb__
Japan.ipynb__

These files contain the filtered and preprocessed tweets from each country's dataset. In each notebook, sentiment analysis has been performed on the tweets specific to that country.

Additionally, there is a combined analysis in the file "EDA_Global_Covid_Dataset.ipynb." This notebook presents data analysis and data visualization, combining the predicted sentiments from all countries' datasets.
